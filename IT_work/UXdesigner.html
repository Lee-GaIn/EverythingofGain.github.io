                The role of a UX designer may be regarded as a bridge between developers teams and customers. 
                The major duties of the UX designer are to analyze user experiences and design interfaces of an application or product. 
                Specifically, they usually devote their time investigating how customers feel about their products by conducting interviews or surveys.

               <p>
                They are also responsible for considering which design is the most effective to express the feature of the product and the most appropriate for their expected customer. 
                They are likely to work with people in various fields such as developers and clients because the UX designer should consider the limitation of implementing their design technically with developers and create designs which meet user expectations. 
                Therefore, it is anticipated that seeking a balance between the limitation of products and user expectation is one of the challenges of UX designers.

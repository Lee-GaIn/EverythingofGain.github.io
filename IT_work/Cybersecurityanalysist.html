                The information security analyst concentrates on secure confidential information by using innovation resolutions. 
                They are responsible for protecting data, maintaining the integrity of significant files preventing cyber invasion, virus and unauthorized access.
                Moreover, they also are aware of the regulation of requirements because information security obligations are changed consistently. 
                In other words, they mostly spend time to monitor security access, evaluate security systems, plan resolutions for malicious data use and verify backup files.

                Information security analysts usually work with their colleagues because most of them work as a team. 
                Some security analysts might be allowed to work from home, but it is unavoidable to interact with team members regularly. 
                They also work with vendors when ensuring regulatory standards. 
                At that time, information security analysts assist vendors to confirm their integrity of technology and system. 
                The difficulty for an information security analyst will probably be that the more technology is advancing the more data to protect increases exponentially.

    <h1> Project Ideas</h1>
    
    <p>
        Overview (100 words) 
        This should be a summary of what the project will be.
        Obesity has become one of the major concerns in the world. In 2016, the fact that over 340 million aged 5 to 19 adolescents and children were obese or overweight is presented by WHO. The project focuses on improving the user's health in terms of diet and regular exercise. To provide a suitable health plan, artificial intelligence will analyze each user’s current statement and recommend appropriate diet and exercise schedules. The service will be offered as a website and it is required software like speech recognition. This project is expected to keep consistency as well as manage user’s health.
         
        Motivation (100 words) 
        This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may include statistics or other evidence.
         
        After industrialization, human lifestyle became more comfortable than prehistoric time. For example, people can spend time to enjoy entertainment rather than storing and gathering food and robot cleaning machines do house chores while people watch television. This change has many advantages such as saving time, but it also has disadvantages in terms of health. For instance, the development of transportation and new entertainment like Esports leads to lack of basic activities in life. People are also exposed to food excessively due to advertisement of processed food, drive thru service and food delivery system and it makes them obsessed with food. This phenomenon leads to obesity. According to WHO reports, obesity has approximately tripled since 1975 world globally. Moreover, it is estimated that 38 million children who under age of 5 are overweight or obese in last year. It could be considered a global crisis in that serious illnesses like heart disease, two types of diabetes and cancer are  caused by obesity. Fortunately, it is preventable if people keep appropriate food portions, the quality of food and regular exercise. This fact  become my motivation

        Description (500 words) 
        Detailed description of the features of the product or service.
         
        The service name is Personal Trainers. It will be developed as an application and website. This service consists of three main parts which is diet, exercise and record. At the first time, the service will require user physical information such as height, weight, purpose and objectives if have. Purpose will be divided by many options like lose or gain weight, gain muscle or maintain a current statement. All elements can be controlled by user’s freedom, but, if users prefer, AI will help them to determine the purpose and objective section based on the Bio Mass Index which is calculated by their height and weight.

        Diet
        It is crucial to eat good quality food with appropriate portions regularly. The main service of this part is to make a diet plan. Users will make a daily or weekly diet by using provided food data. The data have not only calories information about food but also nutritious information like how many proteins the food has. If a user's diet is excessive or lacks recommended calories and nutrition based on their BMI, users will receive warning signs and support from AI. Users may ignore signs and AI proposals, but inappropriate diets will be recorded. Moreover, AI will recommend some restaurant or menu in the restaurant by using GPS service.
        Exercise
        There are two main parts in the exercise section. The first function is making an exercise plan. Users can select the provided exercise method set and time to exercise. Each option has information on burning calories per one hour. If the user sets an excessive exercise plan, AI will give some warning. Another function is that AI will assist users during exercise. AI will provide training class as well as they will give comments by using speech recognition. For example, AI will compliment and encourage users when they get winded and suggest to rest if the user avoids to take a rest over one hour. Moreover, AI will recommend adequate places to exercise  by using GPS service and user’s preferences. For instance, AI will suggest not crowded park if user tend to be distracted by small noise.
         
        Record and Report
        The main function of the record part is updating body measurement changes. If the weight and height changed, AI would analyze all changes and adapt the information to statistics like pie charts and the virtual body image of the user to recognize changes easily which could be the motivation of the user. Users also record their body by taking pictures and write a short diary about diet and exercise. If users want, AI will analyze the user's diary and adapt it in weekly and monthly reports. 
         
        Second R is the report system. In this service, AI will present personal reports and modify tactics to provide an efficient plan  based on the user's monthly diet, exercise, health diary and changes compared to last month. AI will show users significant points which could be good to maintain or need to improve. For example, if it is analyzed that users overeating habits caused by emotional problems in their health diary, AI will report relationships between them which users might not recognize. Another example is, to guarantee various kinds of food, AI will recommend alternative food in the same food group if the user eats the similar food consistently.

        List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software, and hardware required?
        Outcome (100 words) 
        If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?
        The main crucial key to success in this service will be willingness and honesty of the user. Although the service may contain some vulnerabilities such as , the project will contribute to improve people’s healthy life as long as the user makes efforts to follow their plan consistently and update their changes to find the most efficient tactics. It is anticipated that becoming healthy contributes to not only improving the quality of individual life but also economic benefit. Specifically, people who cannot work due to obese can involve labour market if they lose weight. Moreover, in the medical area, usage of special equipment such as obese ambulence which require much money will decrease. Moreover, people’s lifespan will probably prolonged

        Tools and Technologies (100 words)
          Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.
          There are mainly three required tools and technologies which are Speech to text & Text to speech, artificial intelligence and application making programs. The first required tool is Speech to text & Text to speech. STT means recognizing user voice and converting user speech to text, vice versa TTS means converting text to voice by using machine voice.The well-known examples of this are Siri, Google Docs Voice Typing and Amazon Lex Next, AI technology is also required. AI refers to programmed machines to mimic human behavior and learn itself from new experience. In recent years, AI has been applied in many services, specifically riding apps like uber. Lastly, the service will be offered by application. Nowadays, most people tend to use phones rather than computers so  it is necessary to offer service in various types to enhance accessibility.

          It is difficult to implement artificial intelligence because it requires numerous database and programming languages, however it might be possible to  implement Speech to text & Text to speech and making applications. First, Speech to text & Text to speech will possibly be implemented by open source and other companies’ services.There are many companies that support free STT and TTS services. Moreover, open source speech recognition is available in the python library. If team members study independently  with free tutorials from global developers, it is possible to implement those technologies. Next, to build new applications, many programming languages such as C and java are required. Moreover, team members may consider studying a number of software depending on the operating system. Although it sounds impossible to study all of a language in the short term, there are several app makers like MIT app inventor,AppsBuilder which do not acquire knowledge and even coding skills. Overall,It is expected that the team may not build a commercially available application but at least they can offer basic services.

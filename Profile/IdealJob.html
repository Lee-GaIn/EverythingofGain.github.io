                  UI/UX designer is an occupation to plan and design applications according to the customer's needs and usage purpose. 
                  User Interface refers to determining which shape and colour are the most appropriate for each function. 
                  User Experience means analyzing which function is expected when consumers use the applications and organizing the most efficient blueprint.
                   I expect that my aptitude might be suitable in this field. I prefer to communicate with people. 
                   I am also interested in art and tend to enjoy designing and decorating, so I believe I can adjust as a UI/UX designer.

              <p>
                  This job requests communication skill, portfolio to present creativity and knowledge in art, certification of programs and experience of several years. 
                  The main task of the designer is analyzing the consumer's needs, so they should prefer to interact with the user to design appropriate blueprints. 
                  Applicants are also expected to be creative and knowledgeable about the art
                   because another task is designing an interface that customers will approach when using the services for the first time. 
                   Moreover, the candidates should be proficient in programs like Figma and also have working experience of a few years in the same field.

                Fortunately, I have communication skills. 
                I was president of the club. 
                At that time, I learned how to communicate with people and alleviate conflicts. 
                For instance, there was a communication problem in the high school club. 
                In the beginning, club members contacted each other by online chat due to busy schedules. 
                This alternative had seemed perfect, but online chat sometimes caused misunderstanding.
                 To resolve this concern, our club decided to hold a face-to-face meeting regularly and make mentoring programs to establish a stable connection between freshmen and seniors.

              <br>
              <p>
                My plan consists of independent studying, club activity and an internship. 
                I will prepare a portfolio by studying UI design in Linkedin and making my web page. 
                Additionally, I will join the developer club in RMIT to create various programs and apply my design. 
                Moreover, participating in an internship will provide the opportunity to experience not only facing common issues as a designer but understanding abilities I have to develop further.

                    The application name is Personal Trainers. It will be built as an application form.
                    The application consists of four main services which are diet, exercise, record and report.
                    In the beginning, the application will require user physical information such as height, weight, age, purpose and objectives if have.
                    The purpose may be divided by many options like to lose or gain weight, gain muscle or maintain a current state.
                    The objectives refer to the target weights.  This information will be the foundation of the service to provide a proper diet and exercise plan.
                    All elements can be controlled by the user, but the AI will help them automatically to determine the purpose and objective based on the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm">Bio Mass Index</a>>,
                    which estimates body fat based on height and weight if the user prefers
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4 id="Diet">Diet</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The main service of this part is to make a diet plan and review the plan. The service aims to encourage eating good quality food with appropriate portions regularly. In this section, users will make a daily or weekly diet by using provided food data and examine the achievement rate of the plan by themselves. The food data has calories and nutrition information containing a ratio of carbohydrate, protein, fat and vitamins. If a user's diet is excessive or lacks recommended calories and nutrition based on their BMI, users will receive warning signs and support from AI to plan an appropriate diet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The user also will overview a daily diet to measure plan achievement after the day is over. Depending on achievement ratio, the circle icon with traffic sign colour will appear on the diet calendar. For example, the red icon will emerge if the user does not follow their diet plan more than five elements, whereas the green icon will occur if the user implements all of the planned factors. It is allowed that the user ignores warning signs and AI proposals, but inappropriate diets and accomplishment ratio will be recorded as a database for a monthly report.

                <h4 id="Exercise">Exercise</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first function is devising an exercise plan. Users can choose exercise time and the provided exercise method such as swimming, walking, running and jump rope. Each method has information on burning calories per hour. If the user establishes an excessive exercise plan, AI might give some warning because overtraining may cause several injuries and interrupt consistency with exercise.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another function is that AI will assist users directly during exercise. They not only offer exercise class for a user but advise suitable posture. Specifically, AI will teach each exercise step by using the provided audio and support a user to reach a suitable posture by detecting a user's posture. For example, when AI teaches squat to a user, they inform the user of the first step of a squat. If the user performs proper posture of squat, AI will notify the next steps. However, AI will advise users to spread their legs more if the posture of the user is not suitable. Moreover, AI will give several comments about the reaction of a user by using speech recognition. For example, AI will complement a user when the user breathes rapidly since they are exhausted and suggest to rest if the user avoids taking a rest over one hour.

                <h4 id="Record">Record</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The main service of the record section is to update body state changes.
                    If the weight and height changed, AI would analyze all changes and adapt the information to statistics like pie charts and the virtual body image of the user to recognize changes easily which could be the motivation of the user. It is also available that a user records their body by taking pictures and writes a short diary about diet and exercise. As long as the user prefers, AI will analyze their log and adapt it in monthly reports.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4 id="Report">Report</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the report system, AI will present analysis results of diet plan, exercise plan and personal diary per month and modify tactics to provide an efficient diet and exercise method based on the monthly analysis. In a monthly report, AI will show users significant points which should maintain or need to improve on the analysis and changes compared to last month. For example, if it is estimated that users overeating habits caused by emotional problems in their diary, AI will account for relationships between them which users might not recognize to raise awareness. Furthermore, AI will propose several alternatives depending on the difficulties of a user. Typically, to guarantee consuming various kinds of food, AI will recommend alternative food in the same food group if the user eats similar food consistently.

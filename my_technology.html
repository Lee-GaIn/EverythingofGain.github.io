        Chatbot is a computer program which allows people to communicate with computers as a human by using various forms like voice and message to automate the operation process. The chatbot mainly has two types which are take-driven chatbot and data-driven and predictive chatbot. The main difference between take-driven chatbot and data-driven chatbot is variability. 
        
        Most take-driven chatbots usually conduct singular and basic tasks like FAQs. This chatbot tends to generate static responses because it returns the standard responses based on the rules made by developers. It means that the chatbot will probably perform well the more requests are simple, specific and typically similar to the developer's expectation to the users. The example of take-driven chatbots are easily found in e-commerce websites, on facebook messenger and on a live chat. The chatbot type is the most common type although this chatbot type looks like it has a number of limitations in variability and flexibility of command. 
        
        On the other hand, data-driven and predictive chatbot  can handle unprogrammed situations by using databases from user past behavior and their profile. They can not only understand natural language that people normally use unlike computer language but also use predicted intelligence to offer personalized optimization to each user. They are frequently used to provide recommendations to users and even predict their needs based on preferences. The examples of these models are Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Google home. [https://www.oracle.com/chatbots/what-is-a-chatbot/#link9] Even though this remarkable chatbot has a lot of advantages, the critical drawback is that it requires a bunch of data from the user and time to analyze and learn data.
        
        
        Chatbot brings cost savings and operational efficiency in business. It normally contributes to connections between customers and enterprises. Dian Xiaomihttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/07/23/the-amazing-ways-chinese-tech-giant-alibaba-uses-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/?sh=17bff1a7117a and Kikbot https://www.kik.com/blog/how-to-get-started-with-chatbots-on-kik/#:~:text=How%20does%20a%20Kik%20chatbot,like%20login%20and%20message%20management. are one of the good examples which make connections between customers and enterprises. Alibaba,one of the biggest ecommerce chinese companies, developed Dian Xiaomi, AI based chatbot. According to Forbes, chatbots have the ability to understand more than 90% of customers' requests and it responds to a number of requests from approximately 35 million customers daily. Since the chatbot has been able to resolve most basic requests, customer consultants can focus on solving problems related to complex service. It results in reduction of tasks associated with customer services.Another example is Kik Bot launched by kik messenger app in Canada. This chatbot provides not only chatting service between user and chatbot but also entertainment such as game and recommendation fashion tips based on user age and preferences. Moreover, the users develop their own chatbot as well as can get them from store for chatbot so-called bot shop. https://www.kik.com/bots/ To sum up, chatbot is used in various ways in terms of optimization to avoid repetitive tasks.  
        Chatbots have numerous possibilities in the future. Research Nester reported that in 2015 the global chatbots market was worth approximately 88.5 million USD. They also predicted that the value of the market will increase 35.08% annually from 2016 to 2023. https://www.researchnester.com/reports/global-chatbots-market-analysis-opportunity-outlook-2023/30 
        It is anticipated that chatbot will be used actively in medical areas in terms of emotional and social support and consistent and instant patient care. Frontiers reports that people being socially excluded have a more positive mood after chatbot emotional support. It is evident that chatbot offers nutritious benefits to people regarding it has the ability to overcome geographical and time barriers and reach large numbers of people. It also estimated that chatbot might be effective at reducing negative emotion in cyberbullying. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03061/full#h6
        Chatbot is a software which recognizes a user's command consisting of the natural language, performs the command and makes output its result. The process of chatbot is divided into three steps; processing of natural language by using artificial neural networks and machine learning, identification of customer’s precise intent and making inference after understanding the scenario.Therefore, It is obvious that the most crucial technology will be to transform natural language to computer language. 
        .https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/1566/1/PLN_31_42.pdf
        In order to transform natural language to computer language, it is crucial to analyze natural language. Developers and linguists have started to research morphemes which is the smallest unit of language and built a massive database consisting of structured sets of texts called corpus. Unlike language dictionaries, the database contains real people conversation records. However, it is challenging to build relationships among words because all words just recognize unicode for the computer. https://chatbotsmagazine.com/introduction-to-word-embeddings-55734fd7068aTo resolve the issue, developers apply a new method called word embeddings by using C++. One of the pre-trained word embeddings technology is Google's word2vec. It contributes to transforming each word to a vector. As similar words have similar vectors, computers are able to understand not only relationship words but also patterns of the words. For example, computers can recognize queen and king to women and men and it can also infer that usually specific adjectives are combined with nouns such as beautiful sky or vietnam food.  This development hugely impacted chatbot technology and eventually it was devoted to AI based chatbot.

        In 2018, Facebook reports that approximately 1.4 billion users who use messenger are willing to converse with chatbot. It is evident that positive possibilities of chatbot increase rapidly. In terms of chatbot hugely impacts on increment of productivity by mitigating simple and repetitive tasks, it is anticipated that chatbot will possibly affect many areas especially in customer experience management, healthcare and federal agencies. 
        Customer experience management https://lmistatic.blob.core.windows.net/document-library/boldchat/pdf/en/bold360-impact-of-chatbots-and-ai-on-the-customer-journey-whitepaper.pdf
        In 2018 Logmein, a software company located in Boston, reports that customer agents spend a quarter of time searching for appropriate information related to customer demand.  Adapting chatbot to customer experience management will probably lead to saving time and money in the long-term considering chatbot is specialized in searching information in a short time. Moreover, customer agencies can focus on complex problems. Therefore, It is expected that chatbot will bring increment of quality of customer experience management to customer management if customers demands are distributed to both chatbot and agencies effectively by complexity.

        Chatbot will also be a useful tool in the medical area. Based on the hitconsultant.net, Conversa Health, a health company based in San Francisco, adopted chatbot to improve connection between the healthcare system and patients. They said automating interactions is an effective method to enhance clinical and financial outcomes. They also mentioned that chatbot can not only help to find the root cause of a patient’s problem by personalizing based on each of them 'experience but also assist them immediately. Specifically, chatbot can manage patient without time constriction and furthermore it can pinpoint the root of disease from patient lifestyle and offer lifestyle coaching to prevent chronic illness

        Chatbot will impact on the overall client and company. According to chatbotsmagazine.com,  in 2022 more than 90% of banks will have customer interaction by using chatbots. In other words, time goes by, most enterprises will use chatbots to offer services effectively. This change will probably affect customers and providers. Customers no longer spend much time receiving services and providers also can save time to focus on complex and valuable tasks rather than repeated and simple tasks. 
         
        Although some people assume that chatbot may affect replace human, many organizations predict the possibility will probably be insignificant[미미한]. Based on the
        https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/chatbot/are-chatbots-replacing-the-call-center/#:~:text=The%20ultimate%20aim%20of%20chatbot,provide%20a%20holistic%20customer%20experience., chatbot will not be redundant because the purpose of chatbot’s invention is not replacing humans but improving systems. They strongly argue that the relationship between chatbot and people focus on backing each other[상호보완적]. They also highlight that human intervention is still required since chatbot cannot recognize human emotion.

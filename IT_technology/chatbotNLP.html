                <h4>What does it do?</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A chatbot is a computer program which allows people to communicate with computers as a human by using various forms like voice and message to automate the operation process.
                    The chatbot mainly has two types which are take-driven chatbot and data-driven and predictive chatbot.
                    The main difference between <a href="https://www.oracle.com/chatbots/what-is-a-chatbot/#link9">a take-driven chatbot and data-driven chatbot is variability.</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Most take-driven chatbots usually conduct singular and basic tasks like FAQs.
                    This chatbot tends to generate static responses because it returns the programmed responses based on the rules made by developers.
                    It means that the more requests are simple, specific and typically similar to the developer's expectation, a chatbot will probably accomplish work skillfully.
                    The examples of take-driven chatbots are easily discovered in e-commerce websites, on Facebook messenger and a live chat.
                    The chatbot type is the most common although this chatbot type looks like it has a number of limitations in variability and flexibility of the command.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, data-driven and predictive chatbot can handle unprogrammed situations by using databases from user past behaviour and their profile.
                    They can not only understand natural language that people normally use unlike computer language but also use predicted intelligence to offer personalized optimization to each user.
                    They are frequently used to provide recommendations to users and even predict the needs of customers based on preferences.
                    The examples of these models are Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Google home. Even though this remarkable chatbot has a lot of advantages,
                    the critical drawback is that it requires numerous data from the user and time to analyze and learn data.

                    Chatbot brings cost savings and operational efficiency in business. It contributes to connections between customers and enterprises.

                    are one of the examples which make connections between customers and enterprises.
                    Alibaba, one of the biggest e-commerce Chinese companies, developed Dian Xiaomi, AI-based chatbot.
                    According to Forbes, chatbots have the ability to understand more than 90% of customers' requests and it responds to many requests from approximately 35 million customers daily.
                    Since the chatbot has been able to resolve most basic requests, customer consultants can focus on solving problems related to complex service.
                    In other words, It results in the reduction of tasks associated with customer services. Another example is Kik Bot launched by KIK messenger app in Canada.
                    This chatbot provides not only chatting service between user and chatbot but also entertainment such as game and recommendation fashion tips based on user age and preferences.
                    Moreover, the users develop their own chatbot as well as can get them from the store for a chatbot so-called
                    <a href="https://www.kik.com/bots/">bot shop.</a>
                    In conclusion, a chatbot is used in various ways in terms of optimization to avoid repetitive tasks.

                <br>
                 <p>
                    Chatbots have a variety of possibilities in the future.
                     Researchnester.com shows that <a href="https://www.researchnester.com/reports/global-chatbots-market-analysis-opportunity-outlook-2023/30"> in 2015 the global chatbots market was worth approximately 88.5 million USD.
                     They also predicted that the value of the market will increase by 35.08% annually from 2016 to 2023.</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It implies that chatbot will be utilized vigorously in many areas.
                    In particular, in terms of emotional and social support and consistent and instant patient care, it will be possibly used in the medical field actively.
                    According to Frontiers, people being socially excluded have a more positive mood after chatbot emotional support.
                    It is evident that chatbot brings nutritious benefits to people regarding it has the ability to overcome geographical and time barriers and reach large numbers of people.
                    It also estimated that chatbot might be effective at <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03061/full#h6">reducing negative emotion in cyberbullying.</a>
                    Thus, a chatbot will be pervasive in our daily life and contribute to elevating the quality of life.

                <br>
                <p>
                    A chatbot is a software which recognizes a user's command consisting of the natural language, performs from the command and makes output.
                    The process of a chatbot is divided into three steps; the processing of natural language by using artificial neural networks and machine learning, identification of customer’s precise intent and making inference
                    after understanding the scenario.
                    Accordingly, It is obvious that the most crucial technology will be to transform natural language into computer language.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In order to transform natural language into computer language, it is essential to analyze natural language.
                    To implement transformation between the language of human and computer, developers and linguists have started to research morphemes
                    which is the smallest unit of language and built a massive database consisting of structured sets of texts called <a href="https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/1566/1/PLN_31_42.pdf">corpus.</a>
                    Unlike language dictionaries, the database contains real people conversation records. However, it is challenging to build relationships among words because all words just recognize Unicode for the computer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To resolve the issue, developers apply a new method called word embeddings by using C++.
                    One of the pre-trained word embeddings technology is Google's word2vec.
                    It contributes to transforming each word into a <a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/introduction-to-word-embeddings-55734fd7068a">vector</a>.
                    As similar words have similar vectors, computers are able to understand not only relationship words but also patterns of the words.
                    For example, computers can recognize queen and king to women and men and it can also infer that usually specific adjectives are combined with nouns such as the beautiful sky or Vietnam food.
                    This development hugely impacted chatbot technology and eventually it was devoted to AI-based chatbot.

                <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In terms of chatbot hugely impacts on the increment of productivity by mitigating mundane and repetitive work,
                    it is anticipated that chatbot will possibly affect many areas especially in customer experience management and healthcare.

                <br>
                <p>
                    In 2018 Logmein, a software company located in Boston,
                    states that customer agents spend a quarter of time searching for appropriate information related to customer demand.
                    Adapting chatbot for customer experience management will probably lead to saving time and cost in the long-term considering <a href="https://lmistatic.blob.core.windows.net/document-library/boldchat/pdf/en/bold360-impact-of-chatbots-and-ai-on-the-customer-journey-whitepaper.pdf">chatbot is specialized in searching for information in an instant.</a>
                    In addition, customer agencies can concentrate on sophisticated problems.
                    Therefore, It is expected that chatbot will bring increment of quality of customer experience management to customer management if customers' demands are distributed to both chatbot and agencies effectively by complexity.

                <p>
                    A chatbot will also be a useful tool in the medical area.
                    The article on hitconsultant.net illustrates that <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2018/03/21/chatbots-in-healthcare-use-cases/#.X8cp6W7_zIW">Conversa Health, a health company based in San Francisco, adopted chatbot to improve the connection between the healthcare system and patients.</a>
                    They explained automating interactions is an effective method to enhance clinical and financial outcomes.
                    They also mentioned that chatbot can not only help to find the root cause of a patient’s issues by personalizing based on each of them 'experience but also assist them immediately.
                    Specifically, a chatbot can manage patient without time constriction and it can pinpoint the root of disease from patient lifestyle and offer lifestyle coaching to prevent chronic illness

                <br>
                <p>
                    A chatbot will impact on the overall client and company.
                    According to chatbotsmagazine.com, <a href="https://chatbotsmagazine.com/chatbot-report-2019-global-trends-and-analysis-a487afec05b">2022 more than 90% of banks will have customer interaction by using chatbots.</a>
                    In other words, time goes by, most enterprises will use chatbots to offer services effectively.
                    This change will probably affect customers and providers.
                    Customers no longer spend much time receiving services and providers also can save time to focus on complicated and valuable tasks rather than burdensome and tedious works.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Although some people assume that chatbot may affect replacing humans, many organizations predict the possibility will probably be insignificant.
                    Based on the globaltechcouncil.org, a chatbot will not contribute to layoffs of an employee because <a href="https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/chatbot/are-chatbots-replacing-the-call-center/#:~:text=The%20ultimate%20aim%20of%20chatbot,provide%20a%20holistic%20customer%20">the purpose of chatbot’s invention is not replacing humans but improving systems. </a>
                    They strongly argue that the relationship between chatbot and people define complementary and supportive.
                    They also highlight that human intervention is still required since chatbot cannot recognize human emotion.
                    The effect of chatbot may not be as enormous as generally expected in the labour market though it is possible that several people will lose their job.

                    The strength of chatbot is they provide service regardless of place and time limitation.
                    This feature will benefit customers as well as the company.
                    It is expected that the enterprise can offer advanced customer services to numerous customers in a shortened time.
                    In other words, it will not only increase productivity but concentrate on tasks which strongly require sophisticated operation by people.

                    From the customer's point of view, it might be convenient for some people who cannot use the service due to the inevitable environment, typically workers, several introverts and residents in rural areas.
                    It is common that most Korean employees working 5 days a week cannot use face to face service from banks and post offices because the hours of operation are similar to a worker's business hours.
                    It is forced to dedicate their half of lunchtime or take a half-day off in order to deal with trivial tasks. Other examples might be several introverts.
                    Some friends of mine struggle to attempt communication with strangers.
                    They even have a hard time ordering beverages in cafes or asking for a knife in restaurants.
                    The issue is also adapted in connecting to customer service centres.
                    Some citizens who live in the countryside have similar problems.
                    The article of world.kbs.co.kr mentioned that <a href="https://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=e&Seq_Code=155892#:~:text=Korea's%20Population%20Resides%20in%20Seoul%20Metro%20Area%20as%20of%202019,-Write%3A%202020-08&text=Half%20of%20South%20Korea's%20population,percent%20from%20a%20year%20["> half of Korea's population lived in the capital.</a>
                    It results in that company reluctant to franchise in rural areas.
                    This phenomenon causes inconvenience to some customers since they have to move long distances which takes lots of time and cost.
                    The common concern of those people is an unavoidable environment.
                    Though they merely want to process simple tasks, it demands considerable cost, time and burdensome.
                    To solve the lack of accessibility, a chatbot might be an effective alternative in terms of providing services without the constraint of location and time.
                    People will probably no longer suffer from devoting their property for daily and simple tasks.
                    It eventually leads to the improvement of life quality.
